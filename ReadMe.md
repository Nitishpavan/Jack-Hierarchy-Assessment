# Jack In The Box Hierarchy Manager

This project is a take-home assessment to design and implement an **in-memory hierarchy management module** using TypeScript. The goal is to represent Jack in the Box’s organizational structure — from **Franchises** to **Regions** to **Stores**.

To install the dependencies, please run the below command:
`npm install`

To run the test cases present inside src/**tests**/hierarchy.spec.ts, use the below command:
`npx jest`

To kick-off the code, we shall run index.ts that's present inside the /src folder. Please run the below command to trigger the index.ts to see the desired output:

`npx ts-node src/index.ts`
